## About

Monster Curiosity Calculator (MCC) is a database-driven statistics application developed to help answer niche questions about pocket-sized monsters. 
It uses a Python script to query an existing RESTful API, gathering all needed data into an easy to parse file. 
That data is then processed in a C++ application to generate a SQLite database that can be interacted with using a GUI developed using the Dear ImGui library.
